La Roja celebrates after Olga Carmona scored the winner against Sweden at Eden Park in Auckland on August 15. Marty Melville/AFP/Getty Images  La Roja has been one of the tournament's most exciting sides, with its high-possession, high-scoring style. A huge wake-up call was delivered in the side's 4-0 loss to Japan in the final group stage game, but the Iberian nation has been unstoppable since, defeating Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden along the way to the final. In its semifinal against the Bl√•gult, Spain shocked a team which vanquished the all-powerful US women's squad. Teenager Salma Paralluelo seemed to have won it for Spain with an 81st-minute strike which broke the deadlock, only for Sweden to level with a brilliant goal from Rebecka Blomqvist in the 88th minute.   But with extra-time looming, Spains response was ruthless and immediate. Saving the best goal until last, Olga Carmona found the back of the net with a sublime effort from the edge of the box just 94 seconds after Sweden had made it 1-1.  Competing at just its third World Cup, Spain is now within a game of winning the sports biggest prize having never before progressed beyond the round of 16.",
